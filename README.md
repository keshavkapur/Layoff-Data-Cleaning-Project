# Layoff-Data-Cleaning-Project
This project In MySQL focuses on cleaning a dataset related to layoffs in various companies. The data was initially unstructured, containing errors, missing values, and inconsistencies. The goal was to clean and standardize the data to improve its usability for analysis.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- Total Records Before and After Cleaning: To measure the impact of data cleaning.
- Missing Values Removed: Percentage of null values handled.
- Standardization Rate: Percentage of corrected inconsistent values.
- Duplicate Records Removed: Number of redundant entries eliminated.

## Insights Gained:
- Identified industries and companies most affected by layoffs.
- Standardized company names and industry labels for accurate grouping.
- Removed inconsistencies in date formats and categorical variables.
- Ensured data completeness, making it more reliable for future analysis.

## Steps Taken for Data Cleaning:
- Loaded the Dataset:  Imported the raw data for analysis.
- Handled Missing Values: Removed or imputed null values.
- Fixed Inconsistencies: Standardized text formats, date formats, and categorical data.
- Removed Duplicates: Ensured each record was unique.
- Validated Data: Checked for outliers and anomalies.
- Exported Cleaned Data: Saved the final version for further analysis.

## Conclusion:
The data cleaning process significantly improved the dataset's quality, making it ready for visualization and deeper analysis. This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing in ensuring accurate insights and decision-making.
